# CM2030_averageFace
A program that takes an input of several images and amalgamates them into one average image.

In this project 30 images of faces from the set of face images generated by AI were used to create an average image.

The images were combined using linear interpolation.

This was one of four mini projects that amounted to my Final submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming

The other projects were:
  
  CM2030_3DSinGames
  CM2030_webcamPiano
  CM2030_InstagramFilter

This project utilizes JavaScript and the p5.js library to average a series of images together.
